"There’s gold, and it’s haunting and haunting;
	It’s luring me on as of old;
Yet it isn’t the gold that I’m wanting
	So much as just finding the gold.
It’s the great, big, broad land ’way up yonder,
	It’s the forests where silence has lease;
It’s the beauty that thrills me with wonder,
	It’s the stillness that fills me with peace."

"To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
'Cause there'll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door"
