"There’s gold, and it’s haunting and haunting;
	It’s luring me on as of old;
Yet it isn’t the gold that I’m wanting
	So much as just finding the gold.
It’s the great, big, broad land ’way up yonder,
	It’s the forests where silence has lease;
It’s the beauty that thrills me with wonder,
	It’s the stillness that fills me with peace."

		--"The Spell of the Yukon," Robert Service
