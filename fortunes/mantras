Be the role model of who you want to be.

Water. Sleep. Nutrition. Exercise.
%
Start walking. You'll feel better than if you spend forever figuring out which
way to walk.
%
Reach out to someone who you've interacted with recently and tell them something
you appreciate about them or that interaction.
%
Everything changes.
%
Both good moods and bad moods get better when shared.
%
People are what matters.
%
When something puts you in a bad mood or makes you tense, it probably did the
same to others involved with it. Let them know how much you appreciate them.
%
Embrace the pieces of yourself that go against the grain. Don't waste all your
energy fighting who you are.
%
Your anger at the problems around you might be driven by fear that you don't
know how to solve them all. Strive to share a solution, not the anger.
%
Strive to be inclusive of all people, not all behaviors.
%
You belong here.
%
You don't need to be better than anyone else. You just need to be.
%
Breathe.
%
You cannot read minds.
%
Take breaks, not shortcuts.
%
Published beats perfect.
